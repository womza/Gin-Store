    <p><strong>2. </strong>You will need an FTP client, FileZilla is recommended, download it from <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php">https://filezilla-project.org/download.php</a></p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> Extract the downloaded PrestaShop files to your local folder, and then upload it to your hosting via the FTP client.</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> Once the files are uploaded, you need to create database on your hosting provider (if you don't know how, ask them to assist you and help you out, this step is very different from hosting to hosting).</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> Open the URL in your browser where you have uploaded the PrestaShop files, for example <u>www.yourdomain.com/prestashop/</u></p>
    <p><strong>6. </strong>The install process will begin.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="img/ps1.png" width="890" height="766" /></p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> Choose your language and click <strong>&quot;next&quot;</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>12.</strong> Rename the <strong>&quot;Admin&quot;</strong> folder to something else, for security reasons, and remember the folder name, you will use it to access your PrestaShop admin panel, for example http://www.yourdomain.com/prestashop/adminrenamed/ &lt;- this will be your admin access URL.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Q. I canâ€™t install the theme via theme installer from PrestaShop, what should i do?</strong><br />
